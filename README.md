# 8-bit-ripple-counter-
This report covers the design, implementation, and simulation of an 8-bit ripple counter using JK-Flipflops. The project is implemented in Cadence Virtuoso using CMOS transistors. The primary components utilized are 2-input NAND gates and 3-input NAND gates. Each JK-Flipflop is built from these basic gates.
